# DL-Framework
The DL-Framework is an approach to generate an experimental environment that can easily be reused and extended but without the requirements to change core functionality.
The framework is implemented using Tensorflow 2.0 in combination with tf.keras.
If you add new model functionalities, like data loading, these operations should be handled by the framework and not be implemented again and again.
The same situation for the training loop.
In a segmentation task, the training loop for all kind of networks is completely identical, it's not necessary to implement these loops for each model.

For more flexibility, the framework is configured by YAML configuration files.
This allows it, flexibly, to configure experiments without dying in an argument hell of a command-line application.
Additional pre-processing methods, metrics or loss functions can easily append or replaced just by changing the parameter in an experiment configuration.

If something is missing, don't hesitate to implement it!
A model is missing? Checkout out the already implemented models and start with your implementation.
This is also the case for loss functions, data loaders, metrics or pre-processing functions.
While semantic segmentation training or classification tasks are identically in the training loop, you can also implement your loop.
The best example is the *CycleGAN* implementation, that overrides the basic training loop.

#### Example configuration
Below is a sample configuration that is used to train a CNN for a segmentation task.
In the experiment section, we define the output folder where all results are saved.
As model the configuration specifies the [vgg_encoder_decoder](https://scheckmedia.github.io/dl-framework/framework/models/VggEncoderDecoder/) and the corresponding parameters.
In this case, the input is an RGB image with a resolution of 512x512 pixels.
We set up the network that we can distinguish between 7 classes.
`Note: &num_classes is YAML syntax to define a variable which we can reuse in our configuration`
With `model_weights` the network is forced to use pre-trained weights at the given path to initialize the network.
By specifying SparseCategoricalCrossentropyIgnore as loss function we override the default loss of the model.
The fact that the `vgg_encoder_decoder` model uses a softmax-layer as the last layer we pass for the argument `from_loggits` as False value.
As mentioned before, we reuse the value of the `num_classes` variable as input for the SparseCategoricalCrossentropyIgnore objective.
As the stochastic gradient descent method, this experiment uses Adam with a learning rate of 0.00001.

During training, the network receives the input from a `tf_record_segmentation_reader`.
Not only the path to the TFRecord and Labelmap file is specified also an option to remap classes.
This functionality allows it to change categories of pixels during training from e.g. class 1 to class 0.
The `preprocess_list` contains a list of data augmentation methods that are applied before the images are fed into the network. Not only single scalars can be used as variables also lists and dictionaries.
In this case, we use the remap-list also for the validation_reader.

For a better overview of the training, the experiment uses two metrics.
First the `SparseCategoricalCrossentropyIgnore` and additional the `SparseMeanIoU`.
All these metric values are logged to Tensorboard by using the callback `SegmentationLogger` but also segmentation mask examples.
The training is executed for 50.000 steps with a batch size of 4 and after every hundredth step, the model is evaluated.
The `save_strategy` ensures that the model is only stored when the value of `validation_sparse_mean_iou` improves.
